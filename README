TESTED PLATFORMS
	IRIX 5.3, 6.2 & 6.3
        (Linux support coming soon (or not so soon, I'm feeling lazy :)...
	 any help on porting appreciated though :)

TESTED DRIVES
	should work on any scsi cd-rom (or cd-r) drive, but only
	tested and known to work with:
	   TOSHIBA XM-3301TA
	   TOSHIBA XM-3501TA
	   PINNACLE RCD-5040 


INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, make nesessary changes to the Makefile,  and then 
        compile the program. You may wanna do something like this:

		zcat readiso-1.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
		cd readiso
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install


HISTORY
	v1.1   - support for reading non ISO9660 discs,
	 	 now uses free MD5 algorithm, support for long options,
		 uses GNU autoconf (hopefully making the compiling of
	         this program bit easier)
	v1.0   - first stable version, only minor changes to v0.5,
		 no need to upgrade if you have allready v0.5.
	v0.5   - added MD5 checksum calculation for imagefiles/discs.	
	v0.3   - some bugfixes, minor changes to code, and better
	 	 reporting of the ISO primay descriptor, also
                 added stuff for Linux support (untested so probably
	         wont work just out of the box :)
	v0.2   - first public release, still very beta...
		 only support for SGI, Linux support not finished.
	v0.1   - first working version

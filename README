HISTORY
	v1.3   - initial Linux support added (finally)
	v1.2.1 - now displays track/image size also in mm:ss:ff format,
	         some cleanup in code to make new MIPSpro compilers complain
                 less on 6.5 :)
	v1.2   - added support for reading audio tracks (tested only
		 with TOSHIBA drives)
	v1.1   - support for reading non ISO9660 discs,
	 	 now uses free MD5 algorithm, support for long options,
		 uses GNU autoconf (hopefully making the compiling of
	         this program bit easier)
	v1.0   - first stable version, only minor changes to v0.5,
		 no need to upgrade if you have allready v0.5.
	v0.5   - added MD5 checksum calculation for imagefiles/discs.	
	v0.3   - some bugfixes, minor changes to code, and better
	 	 reporting of the ISO primay descriptor, also
                 added stuff for Linux support (untested so probably
	         wont work just out of the box :)
	v0.2   - first public release, still very beta...
		 only support for SGI, Linux support not finished.
	v0.1   - first working version
